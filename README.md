# Learning Path Optimization Using Regression & Neural Networks

This project focuses on building a recommendation system to optimize learning paths for students preparing for technical interviews. By leveraging regression models and neural networks, it highlights the most frequently asked topics in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and core Computer Science (CS) subjects. This system provides targeted study recommendations, helping students prioritize their learning effectively.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Min-Max Normalization and One-Hot Encoding for data preparation.
- **Modeling**: Regression and neural network models to predict optimal learning paths.
- **Recommendations**: Personalized study suggestions based on data analysis.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python** for core programming
- **scikit-learn** for preprocessing and regression
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for neural network models
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data visualization
